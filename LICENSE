Some of you may notice that these scripts within this tool belong to Python
For Cybersecurity book and that is true, but I try to modify all the scripts
and decorate them and put them in one single tool. Although, I have to thank 
Fahad Ali Sarwar the owner of that book it gave me a lot of basic idea of what 
it takes to build you own unique set of python tools and it begin from the basics
to creating advanced malware and RAT that stand for Remote Access Tool that allow 
hackers to get the meterpreter shell of the victim's machine. It explore also the 
idea behind BOTNET that start often by exploiting the victim computer and use it as
foothold to access other computers inside the network. finally, He show us how to make
the malware persistence in order to stay on te victim's machine as long as the system 
is alive unless you need to execute the malware everytime on the target's machine
which is not possible because as a hacker often you'll have only one chance to sent 
some malicious file to the victim and YEAH persistence is the key but that will rise
suspecious if you keep sending malicious files.
 
However, that book gave me some knowledge to build on that and create more sophisticated
tools that will be hard for Intrusion Detection System IDS to detect it which is what we
want but the scripts in this tool it's not that sophisticated some of them are pretty 
advanced. So, if you know python you can download the tool and add some tweaks to it.

[!] I want to make a plugin here for some beginners if you change the DIRECTORIES NAME
of these scripts you'll get an ERROR message say "no such a file or directory" which some
of you may think there's no scripts here! So, let them as they are and it will work just 
fine and one more thing, as you can see I called my script "warriorx55.py" you can change it
to your name or any name you want it will not make any difference.
