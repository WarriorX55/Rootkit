This Package include some powerfull scripts to execute verious tasks. However some advanced scripts need to executed using both on linux & windows powershell.
So, feel free to test them and I think I shold put an instructions within each tool soon to have better understanding at how to run them properly. 
But most of them will work try to play around with them..
