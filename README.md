# IPGeolocator
Lucky for us that MaxMind offers a developer version of the database for free, and that someone developed a Python module to query this database. So by making a script with this module we can effectively develop an IP Geo-Location tool.

# usage
maxmind_db_ip_geolocator.py [-h] [-u URL] [-t IP] [--dat DATFILE]

Letâ€™s attempt to use our script

![install](https://github.com/WarriorX55/IPGeolocator/assets/141424663/d965978a-2213-480b-9d5a-75f7f0676397)

We can see that the automatic installation is going through just fine (The database installation may take a minute, as it is quite a lot to download and decompress). Now we just have to wait for the query to complete:

![query](https://github.com/WarriorX55/IPGeolocator/assets/141424663/f4ed520f-a119-470e-b1f6-16aa98eb105c)

That does it for this one!
Now that we have our Locator object, we call the check_database()
function as a method in order to run it. Once that function is complete, 
we call the query() function as a method in order to execute our query.
