This Package include some powerfull scripts to do verious tasks. However some advanced scripts need to executed using both on linux & windows 
powershell. So, feel free to test them and I think I should put an instruction within each tool soon to have better understanding at how to run 
them properly. But most of them will work just try to play around with them. As you can see I named my script warriorx55.py if you want to put your name or any name happens to be it's totally fine.
